# ai-image-classifier
A PyTorch Image classifier based on Convolutional Neural Network and Supervised Learning

* The only file you need is ai_image_classifier.py
* you can use it to train a model in three lines of code.
* The model uses a ResNet backbone.

See [example](https://github.com/manuelsilverio/ai-image-classifier/blob/main/example/example.ipynb) implementing this classifier to distinguish between oranges and pears:

Here is the training with 150 images for training and 50 images for validation for each class:
